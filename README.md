## 🚦 Project Current Status & Known Issues (2024-06)

### ✅ Implemented

- Subscription system (Free/Pro/Elite, AI model permissions, quota limits, pricing, etc.)
- AI Learning Assistant (GPT-3.5/GPT-4o, multi-modal support, task context, conversation history)
- Course import, task management, course overview, review cards, weekly reports and other core features
- Supabase backend (Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage) integration with frontend
- Modern UI, responsive design, navigation and subscription access

### ⚠️ Typical Known Issues

- **AI Conversation Creation Errors**:
  - `Could not find the 'messages' column of 'ai_conversations' in the schema cache` (fixed, due to type and API inserting extra fields)
  - `violates foreign key constraint "ai_conversations_user_id_fkey"` (common cause: not logged in/logged in user not synced to users table, or invalid user_id)
- **User Login/Registration and Database Sync**:
  - Users registered through Supabase Auth don't automatically sync to public.users table, need to ensure user_id exists in users table, otherwise AI-related foreign key constraints will fail.
- **Local Development Environment**:
  - If directly manipulating database or manually inserting into users table, may cause inconsistency between auth and users table.
- **Style Resource Loading Warnings**:
  - Some environments have warnings about stylesheet loading failures, doesn't affect main functionality.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Suggestions

- When encountering AI assistant-related foreign key errors, first check if logged in, whether user_id exists in users table.
- If no users table record after registration/login, can manually insert a record with id consistent with auth.users.
- If other bugs or exceptions, suggest console.log related user information and provide feedback.
